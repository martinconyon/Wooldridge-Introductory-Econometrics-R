# Instructions:
# 1. Set your working directory to the folder where you have saved this script.
#    You can do this by using the setwd() function. For example:
#    setwd("path/to/your/folder")

# 2. Run the script section by section to see the output at each step.

# Load necessary packages
if (!require("wooldridge")) install.packages("wooldridge", dependencies = TRUE)
if (!require("AER")) install.packages("AER", dependencies = TRUE)
if (!require("systemfit")) install.packages("systemfit", dependencies = TRUE)

# Load necessary libraries
library(wooldridge)
library(AER)
library(systemfit)

# Clear the environment
rm(list = ls())

# Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("output")) {
  dir.create("output")
}

# Open log file
sink(file = "output/chapter16_log.txt", split = TRUE)

# Example 16.5-3SLS: Three-Stage Least Squares

# This example demonstrates the use of Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS) for estimating a system of equations.

# Ensure that you run the script Example-16-5-systemfit-prep.R first to define the system of equations and instruments.

# Example 16.5-IVREG: Instrumental Variables Regression

# This example demonstrates the use of 2SLS for individual equations using the AER package.

# Example 16.5-Systemfit-Prep: Preparation for System Estimation

# This script prepares the system of equations and instruments for system estimation using the systemfit package.

# Example 16.5-Systemfit: Two-Stage Least Squares for System

# This example demonstrates the use of Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) for estimating a system of equations.

# Ensure that you run the script Example-16-5-systemfit-prep.R first to define the system of equations and instruments.

# Explanation:
# This script performs multiple regression analyses and simultaneous equation methods from Wooldridge's "Introductory Econometrics".
# The analyses include:
# - Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS)
# - Instrumental Variables Regression (2SLS)
# - System estimation preparation
# - Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) for system estimation
